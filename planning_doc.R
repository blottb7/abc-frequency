# Outputs
# I. % checklists recording species
# A. overall

#. a) include all non ABC instead
# 3. Lake Mills
# 4. top 10 hotspots vs ABC

# II. Comparisons
# A. list ranked by Adams having more
# B. list ranked by Jefferson Co having more
# C. comparisons by taxonomic

# Notes:
# Would probably be useful if not best to compare ABC to more than just
# Zeloski... pick, say, the top 10 hot spots, or all spots with, say,
# 200+ species. Might get some truer percentages.
